# Natural-Language-Processing-in-TensorFlow

I was taking this course [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow) on Coursera, and this is the third course in the [TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) Specialization on Coursera provided by **deeplearning.ai**. Here are the Notebooks I practiced in while taking this course. These Notebooks are initially formed by the course providers **deeplearning.ai**.
